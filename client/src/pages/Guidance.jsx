Recruiters test fundamentals before anything else.\n\nFor Data Science / ML roles: Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, ML algorithms, overfitting, and bias-variance tradeoff.\n\nFor Software Engineering: OOP concepts, SOLID principles, Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps), and Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming).\n\nFor Web Dev / Full Stack: HTML/CSS/JS deeply, React/Node fundamentals, REST APIs, databases (SQL vs NoSQL), HTTP protocol, and authentication.`,

    title: "How to Answer Technical Questions",
    content: `Most candidates jump straight to the answer. Use the Think-Out-Loud method:\n\nStep 1 → Repeat the question: "So you're asking about overfitting — let me explain..."\nStep 2 → Define it clearly: Give a textbook-clean definition first.\nStep 3 → Give an analogy: "It's like a student who memorizes answers without understanding..."\nStep 4 → Give a real example: "In my prediction project, my model had 99% train accuracy but 60% test accuracy..."\nStep 5 → Mention how to solve it: "I used cross-validation and L2 regularization to fix it."`,

Explain Big O notation.\n- Difference between stack and heap memory.\n- What is a deadlock? How do you prevent it?\n\nWEB DEVELOPMENT:\n- What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?\n- Explain the event loop in Node.js.\n- What is the virtual DOM in React?\n- Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.`,

Estimate scale — "1 million users, 100k requests per day"\n3. Define components — Frontend, Backend API, Database, Cache\n4. Choose tech stack — "I'd use PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching"\n5. Discuss trade-offs — "SQL gives ACID compliance but NoSQL scales better horizontally"`,

"I was responsible for the model training and evaluation."\nA — Action: What did YOU do? "I selected XGBoost and handled class imbalance using SMOTE."\nR — Result: What was the outcome? Use numbers.
